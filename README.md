# Purple Calculator
## by Geoffery Powell

This program is a simple single 
operator calculator. It is capable 
of most simple math. It's operators 
include:   
```
*Plus: "+"   
*Minus: "-"    
*Multiplication: "X"   
*Division: "/"   
*Percent of: "%"   
*Equals: "="   
```	
Additionally the calculator can UNDO
and clear "C" values. UNDO removes the 
last recorded value. This can be done 
until you run out of recorded values. 
Equals and clear also clear the undo list. 
Clearing "C" the calculator resets all 
values to blank to start over. The 
calculator also supports decimal numbers 
using "." and negitive numbers which can 
be accessed but pressing Minus "-" before 
inputting a number. 

To preform a math operation start by 
typing your first value. Then type an 
operator followed by your final value. 
If you wish to change your operator you 
may do so at anytime by tapping a new 
operator. Finally you can press 
Equals "=" to view the result. You 
may also add another operator and value 
to continue applying operations to the 
value. 

Themes are available from the menu button
in the top right of the app. Select the three 
dots then Colors. Now you can select any of 
the available color themes.
